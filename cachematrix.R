## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

##As inverting a matrix can be a timeconsuming and costly operation (moreso when
##done often), this functions looks to be able to cache the inverse of a matrix 
##being more efficient.

## Write a short comment describing this function

##the make cache function does the following:
##  set the value of the inverse matrix (null at first)
##  gets the value of the matrix to be reversed
## sets and gets the inverse matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
