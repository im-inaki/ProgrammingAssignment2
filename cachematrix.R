##As inverting a matrix can be a timeconsuming and costly operation (moreso when
##done often), this functions looks to be able to cache the inverse of a matrix 
##being more efficient.

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
